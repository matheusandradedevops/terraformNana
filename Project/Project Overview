Create a VPC
Create One Subnet in one AZ
Connect VPC to internet using internet gateway ( allow traffic )
Deploy ec2 on aws and run a simple docker container on it
Create Security Group to access via browser and ssh (firewall)

---
It's a good practice create infrastructure from scratch ( vpc, subnets etc)
